This is my approach to the Odin Recipes book. I used everything I've learned so far in the course  plus some things 
I already knew and also tried to implement other stuff.
There are some mistakes yet, but as a first attempt I think it is ok.

Let≈õ keep going and learn more everyday!

I'd like to thank The Odin Project for the great initiative to provide such a complete course on Web Development. 

Thanks guys!
